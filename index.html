        <h3>A timeline of Grace Hopper's life</h3>
        <ul id="timeline">
          <li><b class="date">1906</b> - born <strong>Grace Brewster Murray</strong> on December 9, in New York City, U.S.</li>
          <li><b class="date">1928</b> - graduates Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar College with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics</li>
          <li><b class="date">1930</b> - earns her master's degree at Yale University and marries New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper</li>
          <li><b class="date">1931</b> - begins teaching mathematics at Vassar</li>
          <li><b class="date">1934</b> - earns a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale</li>
          <li><b class="date">1941</b> - gets promoted to associate professor at Vassar</li>
          <li><b class="date">1943</b> - enlist in the United States Navy Reserve and trains at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts</li>
          <li><b class="date">1944</b> - graduates and is assigned as a lieutenant to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University, where she serves on the programming staff of <strong>Mark&nbsp;I</strong>, the first large-scale automatic calculator and a precursor of electronic computers</li>
          <li><b class="date">1945</b> - divorces Vincent Foster Hopper but retains his surname</li>
          <li><b class="date">1946</b> - writes the first computer manual, A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, which described how to operate Mark&nbsp;I and was the first extensive treatment of how to program a computer</li>
          <li><b class="date">1947</b> - while working on a Mark II Computer her associates discover a moth that was stuck in a relay and impeding the operation of the computer. Upon extraction, the insect was affixed to a log sheet for that day with the notation, "First actual case of bug being found". The case is held as a historical instance of "debugging" a computer and Hopper is credited with popularizing the term in computing.

            <blockquote><q>It was warm in the summer of 1945; the windows were always open and the screens were not very good. One day the Mark II stopped when a relay failed. They finally found the cause of the failure: inside one of the relays, beaten to death by the contacts, was a moth. The operator carefully fished it out with tweezers, taped it in the logbook, and wrote under it "first actual bug found".</q></blockquote>

            </li>
          <li><b class="date">1949</b> - joins the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp., where she works on the design of <strong>UNIVAC I</strong>, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer design for business application,  as head programmer</li>
          <li><b class="date">1952</b> - publishes her first paper on compilers, which she designed to translate a programmer’s instructions into computer codes, even though she <q>was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English.</q>
          <figure class="quote">
          <blockquote><q>It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols, so I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.</q></blockquote>
          </figure>
          The same year she finishes the first link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler (the A compiler).</li>
          <li><b class="date">1953</b> - her division develops A-2 system and releases it to customers. Customers were provided the source code for A-2 and invited to send their improvements back to UNIVAC. Thus, A-2 could be considered an example of the result of an early philosophy similar to free and <strong>open-source</strong> software</li>
          <li><b class="date">1957</b> - her division develops <strong>Flow-Matic</strong>, the first English-language data-processing compiler, which had many features that inspired the development of <strong>COBOL</strong>, granting her the nickname "Grandma COBOL"</li>
          <li><b class="date">1986</b> - retires from the navy with the rank of rear admiral as the oldest officer on active U.S. naval duty</li>
          <li><b class="date">1992</b> - dies in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington County, Virginia, at age 85, and is interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery</li>
          <li><b class="date">2016</b> - posthumously receives the <strong>Presidential Medal of Freedom</strong>, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in recognition of her remarkable contributions to the field of computer science</li>
        </ul>
